# Examples of SOLID principles in PHP


1) S - Single Responsibility Principle (<a href='1-single-responsibility-principle.php'>SRP</a>)

    This principle states that a class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

2) O - Open/Closed Principle (<a href='2-open-closed-principle.php'>OCP</a>)

    This principle states that objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

3) L - Liskov Substitution Principle (<a href='3-liskov-substitution-principle.php'>LSP</a>)

    Liskov substitution says that derived classes must be substitutable for thier base classes. 

4) I - Interface Segregation Principle (<a href='4-interface-segregation-principle.php'>ISP</a>)

    A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

5) D - Dependency Inversion Principle (<a href='5-dependency-inversion-principle.php'>DIP</a>)

    Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
