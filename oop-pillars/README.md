# Object-oriented programming pillars in PHP

Abstraction (<a href='abstraction.php'>SRP</a>)
    Abstract means a concept or an Idea which is not associated with any particular instance. Using abstract class/Interface we express the intent of the class rather than the actual implementation.
    It allows us to simplify complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem. Abstraction of Data or Hiding of Information is called Abstraction!

Polymorphism (<a href='polymorphism.php'>SRP</a>)
    Polymorphism is the process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input. It is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes. or we can say that object can behave in different forms is call Polymorphism.

Encapsulation (<a href='encapsulation.php'>SRP</a>)
    Encapsulation hides the implementation details of a class from other objects. Binding of Data and Functions (that manipulate the data) together and keep both safe from outside interference and misuse is called Encapsulation. It helps restrict access to public methods. Instance variables are kept private and accessor methods are made public to achieve this.
    in our example in the link above, we are hiding the name and dob attributes of person class.

Inheritance (<a href='inheritance.php'>SRP</a>)
    Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. Inheritance enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects.
