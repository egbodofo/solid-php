# Object-oriented programming pillars in PHP

Abstraction (<a href='abstraction.php'>SRP</a>)
    Abstraction is simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.

Polymorphism (<a href='polymorphism.php'>SRP</a>)
    Polymorphism is the process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input.

Encapsulation (<a href='encapsulation.php'>SRP</a>)
    Encapsulation hides the implementation details of a class from other objects.

Inheritance (<a href='inheritance.php'>SRP</a>)
    Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined.
